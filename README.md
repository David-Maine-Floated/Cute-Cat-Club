## Description


#### Cute Cat Club is a visualizer of different cat breeds and interesting data about each one. The user will be presented a page to search their favorite breeds. The page will dispaly the requested data for the specific breed in a fun styalized way. There are interactive elements of the page, allowing users to customize and style their Cute Cat Club experience. Every day is a party...but mostly a nap...at the Cute Cat Club.

## Because every cat in the world is the cutest cat in the world...All cats are by default members of the Cute Cat Club. 


#### I'll be using the D3 library to help visualize some of the data. As well other CSS and JS styling. 
#### Functionality Idea: use on mouse hover listener to add customization buttons on certian elements. This way the visual aspect of the buttons can be hidden after costimizing is complete. Alternatively could have a single button toggle the reveal of all of the customization tools. Change fonts, colors, names, etc. Not an excessive amount. Could also go the way of having such few customize buttons that they could stylistically part of the display. So users are enticed to touch the buttons.
